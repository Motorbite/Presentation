          <p> Hello, my name's Wilfried, i'm 18 and i'm learning coding with Popschool, a sort of school for beginners. </p>
          <p> I started learning computing when i was 6 with my step-father : we began with little computers and now, i can repair some phones, computers etc...</p>
          <p> At the end of this school, i'll search for a job, in coding, or i'll continue formations, but in computing maintenance and repair. </p>
          <p> Other than computers, i like read (All sorts of books, more Fantasy and Fantastic books), play video games (on computer or video game console), chatting etc...</p>
          <p> These are principal hobbies, i've a lot of them : </p>
                <p>For example</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Music (All i can hear without losing my ears so all except JUL)</li>
              <li> Rollers</li>
              <li> Embort people (i loooooooove it :D)
            </ul>
          <p class="joy"> For the moment, our trainers are a little bit crazy x), more Beno√Æt than the others :D </p>
          <p class="joy"> But more than the impressions, i think we'll have a good formation, we just need to work :p </p>
